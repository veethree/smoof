# smoof.lua

A tiny tweening library for lua.
It's basically linear interpolation wrapped up in a library.

## Usage

#### `smoof:update(dt)`
You need to call this function once per frame. It updates the animation.
'dt' is delta time, Meaning the time that has passed since the last frame in seconds.

### `smoof:new(object, target, smoof_value, completion_threshold, bind, callbacks)`
This function starts an animation.
* object: This needs to be a table, Containing the values you want to tween. Ex: `{x = 0, y = 0}`
* target: Another table, Containing the target value/s. Ex: `{x = 32, y = 64}`
* (Optonal) smoof_value: A number that controls the length of the animation. The lower the number, The faster the animation. Should be in the range of 0 to 1, But not 1. 0.99999... is fine.
* (Optonal) completion_threshold: This value contols how close to the target the value should get before snapping to it and ending the animation.
* (Optional) bind: Boolean, If true, The animation will never be removed from the stack, As a result the object values will constalty animate towards the target.
* (Optional) callbacks: A table containing callback functions, One or more of the following: `onStart`, `onStep`, `onArrive`
  * onStart: Called once when the animation starts
  * onStep: Called each frame of the animation.
  * onArrive: Called once when the animation ends

### `smoof:setDefaultSmoofValue(val)`
This function sets the default `smoof_value` that `smoof:tween` falls back to if one isn't provided.

### `smoof:setCompletionThreshold(threshold)`
This function sets the default `completion_threshold` value that `smoof:tween` falls back to if one isn't provided.

### So what is this useful for?
Anything where you want a smooth animation. Perhaps GUI elements sliding in and out of frame to make your game more juicy.

Here's a gif of it in action.
